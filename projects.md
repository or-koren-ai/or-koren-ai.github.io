  <h2>Marketing Campaign Optimization</h2>
  <p>Applied causal inference techniques to optimize marketing campaigns, driving an additional +$8M/year in revenue.</p>
  
  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <p>Implemented a robust methodology for identifying causal relationships between campaign variables and customer behaviors, allowing for precise optimization of marketing spend across channels.</p>
  
  <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
  <p>Python, PySpark, DoWhy (causal inference library), SQL, Tableau</p>
</div>

<div class="section-card">
  <h2>High-Quality Moderation Models</h2>
  <p>Fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, GPT) for message moderation, achieving 95% accuracy.</p>
  
  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <p>Needed to create a scalable, accurate system to detect inappropriate content across multiple languages and contexts.</p>
  
  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>Developed a custom fine-tuning approach for transformer models that significantly improved detection accuracy while reducing false positives.</p>
